// Game object for BlockCrush. Keeps track of internal objects, handles
// inputs, graphics, score, etc.

// Game Concept: Player block moves up/down on the left side of the 
// screen as walls of blocks move down the screen to "crush" them. Gain 
// points by slipping into gaps in the wall as the walls get faster.

class BCGame {
	field Wall //... well I should make these objects first
}
