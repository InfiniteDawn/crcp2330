/*  Read Me for BlockCrush
	
	Basic Rules of Play:

	Start the game by pressing any key.
	The objective is to avoid the moving walls for as long as possible.
	Game ends when the player block is crushed by a wall.

	Move the player block with the "w" and "s" keys.



	Note: The wall graphics have a hard time keeping up unfortunately. 
	Probably a limitation of JACK.
