# 	Please ensure that version 2.7.12 of Python is installed on the user's PC.
# 	Please note that while a newer version of the 2.7.X branch should work,
# 	version of the 3.X.X branch will likely fail to compile.

# 	Additionally, note that this assembler was designed with valid ASM code in
# 	mind - flawed or invalid ASM code may result in undesirable output.

# 	Basic theory of use:

# 	Enter the "main.py" file and move to the end of the file.
# 	Where the line:

# 		testFile = "[program].asm";

# 	is present, please enter your desired file for compilation.

# 	Then, open a terminal where Python is available, move to the
# 	program directory and run the command:

# 		>>> python main.py

# 	This will execute the script, turning a valid .asm file into its
# 	corresponding .hack binary equivilent.

# 	Note that the filename must include the ".asm" filetype indicator
# 	for the resulting output to properly show the ".hack" filetype - 
# 	though the contents of the file will be correct regardless.

# 	Thank you!
